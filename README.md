# TRS-20 debug driver

This project is an STM32F4 "black pill" driver for a Z180 CPU. It acts as RAM, ROM, and I/O system for the Z180.

There are two blog articles covering this repository. The [first](https://xn--wxa.bje.id.au/posts/trs20/006-fake-it.html) delves into the low level details of programming an STM32F4 directly. The [second](https://xn--wxa.bje.id.au/posts/trs20/007-build-it.html) follows along the first half dozen commits as I carefully configure the clock tree, then have it react to bus signals out of a Z180 processor
